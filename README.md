# ts-playwright-allure
This project is a TypeScript-based automation framework using Playwright for browser and API automation and Allure for test reporting. It provides a scalable and maintainable structure for writing end-to-end tests with a focus on functional and non-functional testing.

## Pre-Requisits
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js
- npm
- allure
- prometheus (optional)
- grafana (optional)
- jenkins (optional)

## Installation
To install the dependencies, run:

### `npm install`

## Usage
- Run all tests

### `npm run tests`

This command will execute all the tests using TypeScript, Playwright, and Allure for reporting.

## Reports
For detailed test reports, including screenshots and additional information, you can check the generated Allure reports after the test execution in a dedicated React reporting app.

### `cd reporting-app; npm run app`
