# ts-playwright-allure
This project is a TypeScript-based automation framework using Playwright for browser and API automation and Allure for test reporting. It provides a scalable and maintainable structure for writing end-to-end tests with a focus on functional and non-functional testing.

## Pre-Requisits
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js
- npm
- prometheus (optional)

## Installation
To install the dependencies, run:

### `npm install`

## Usage
- Run all tests

### `npm run tests`

This command will execute all the tests using TypeScript, Playwright, and Allure for reporting.

## Reports
For detailed test reports, including screenshots and additional information, you can check the generated Allure reports after the test execution in a dedicated React reporting app.

### `cd reporting-app; npm run app`

# Features ToDo

## Version Control
   - Use a version control system (e.g., Git) to manage your code. Keep your automation scripts, configurations, and infrastructure code in version control for traceability, collaboration, and rollback capabilities.

## Project Structure
   - Organize your project into a clear and modular structure. Divide code into logical components and folders for easy maintenance and scalability.

## Dependency Management
   - Utilize package managers (e.g., npm for TypeScript) to manage dependencies. Specify versions of your dependencies to ensure reproducibility.

## Configuration Management
   - Keep configuration settings separate from code. Use configuration files or environment variables to make your code more flexible and easily adaptable to different environments.

## Documentation
   - Document your code comprehensively. Include inline comments, README files, and any other relevant documentation to help other team members understand your infrastructure code.

## Continuous Integration (CI) / Continuous Deployment (CD)
   - Implement Jenkins CI/CD pipelines for automated testing, building, and deployment. This ensures that your automation infrastructure is continuously integrated and tested as changes are made.

## Test Framework
   - Choose a robust testing framework (e.g., Jest for TypeScript) that supports your testing needs. Write clear and maintainable test cases, and consider using Page Object Model (POM) for better test structure.

## Logging and Reporting
   - Implement proper logging for debugging purposes. Integrate Allure for detailed and readable test reports. This helps in identifying issues quickly.

## Error Handling
   - Implement proper error handling mechanisms to make your automation scripts more resilient. Log meaningful error messages to facilitate troubleshooting.

## Security
    - Ensure that sensitive information such as passwords or API keys is securely handled. Avoid hardcoding credentials in your code; use secure methods like environment variables or secure vaults.

## Code Reviews
    - Conduct regular code reviews to ensure code quality, adherence to coding standards, and knowledge sharing among team members.

## Scalability and Maintenance
    - Design your automation infrastructure to be scalable and easy to maintain. Consider future changes and updates, and plan your infrastructure to accommodate them.

## Cross-Browser Testing
   - Ensure your automation framework supports testing across multiple browsers and versions. Playwright is designed for cross-browser testing, so leverage its capabilities to validate your application's compatibility.

## Parallel Execution
   - Implement parallel execution of tests to save time and increase efficiency. This is crucial for handling larger test suites and reducing overall execution time.

## Performance Testing
   - Consider integrating performance testing into your automation infrastructure to identify and address potential performance issues early in the development process.

## Data Management
   - Establish a strategy for managing test data. This may involve setting up a separate environment for testing or creating scripts to prepare and clean up test data before and after test execution.

## Dockerization
   - Dockerize your automation infrastructure to create reproducible and portable test environments. This facilitates consistency across different development and testing environments.

## Continuous Monitoring
   - Implement continuous monitoring for your application and automation infrastructure. This helps detect issues early, such as flaky tests or environmental problems.

## Integration with Test Management Tools
   - Integrate your automation framework with test management tools for better test case organization, execution tracking, and reporting.

## Feedback Loop
   - Establish a feedback loop for developers and QA teams. Use automated notifications or alerts to inform relevant stakeholders about test results, failures, or other critical information.

## Community Support and Updates
   - Keep an eye on updates and releases for the tools and frameworks you are using. Stay connected with the community for support, discussions, and insights into best practices.

## Accessibility Testing
    - Consider incorporating accessibility testing into your automation suite to ensure your application is accessible to users with disabilities.

## Code Quality Metrics
    - Utilize code quality tools and metrics to analyze the health of your codebase. This includes static code analysis, code coverage reports, and adherence to coding standards.

## Versioning
    - Apply versioning to your automation scripts, configurations, and any infrastructure-related components. This ensures that changes are tracked, and you can roll back to previous versions if needed.

## Results Storage
   - Store test results, logs, and relevant metadata in a database. This provides a centralized location for historical test data, making it easier to analyze trends and identify patterns.

## Dashboard Integration
   - Integrate with reporting and dashboard tools to visualize test results. Dashboards provide a quick overview of the health of your application and the status of your test suites.

## Historical Data Analysis
   - Use the database to maintain historical data for trend analysis and performance monitoring. This helps in identifying patterns, regression issues, and improvements over time.

## Test Metrics
   - Capture and store key test metrics in the database. This might include execution time, pass/fail rates, and any custom metrics relevant to your application and testing goals.

## Traceability
   - Establish traceability between test results, code changes, and requirements. This can be valuable for auditing purposes and for understanding the impact of changes on test outcomes.

## Automation Insights
   - Leverage the database to gather insights into automation performance, such as the average execution time, the most frequently failing tests, or any recurring issues.

## Scalability
   - Design the database schema to accommodate scalability. As your test suite grows, having a scalable database architecture ensures optimal performance and responsiveness.

## Security Considerations
   - Implement security measures to protect sensitive data stored in the database, especially if it includes any confidential or personally identifiable information.

## API Integration
   - Consider providing an API for interacting with the database. This allows other tools or systems to fetch and utilize test data programmatically.

## Alerts and Notifications
    - Set up alerts and notifications based on database queries to get real-time information about critical issues or changes in test results.

## Backup and Recovery
    - Establish a robust backup and recovery strategy for the database. Regularly back up your data to prevent data loss and ensure quick recovery in case of failures.
